# Dockermon

### Todo
- [ ] In case of crash, Dockermon should get events from latest retrieved event
- [ ] Pipeline to build and distribute executables
- [ ] One file installer
- [ ] Should give feedback on bad action / type string in configuration file, Docker API doesn't care, even if filter isn't correct
- [ ] Windows compatibility
