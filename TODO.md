# Dockermon

### Todo
- [x] Should give feedback on bad action / type string in configuration file, Docker API doesn't care, even if filter isn't correct
- [x] Pipeline to build and distribute executables
- [x] Add static analysis tool
- [x] Add tests
- [x] Better error reporting
- [x] Build docker event filter
- [ ] One file installer
- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Dockermon should never miss or double handle an event, even in crash and restart condition
- [ ] Windows compatibility
