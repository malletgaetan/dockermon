# Dockermon

### Todo
- [x] Should give feedback on bad action / type string in configuration file, Docker API doesn't care, even if filter isn't correct
- [x] Pipeline to build and distribute executables
- [x] Add static analysis tool
- [x] Add tests
- [ ] Better error reporting
- [ ] Care about efficiency and having machine resource impact as low as possible (don't care about performance)
- [ ] One file installer
- [x] Add more tests


- [ ] ?Dockermon should never miss or double handle an event, even in crash and restart condition
- [ ] ?Windows compatibility
